          <h2>experience.</h2>
          <p>In 2015 I founded my own business serving the St Louis community as a birth & postpartum doula. Throughout this process
          I learned invaluable skills in communication and advocacy. Much of birth work involves bringing together a team of people
          who may never have worked together before to create a supportive environment for the birthing mother. This skill at navigating
          difficult teams, translates directly to solving the puzzles of programming. Often the best work in development is done in teams
          requiring a level of tenacity, calmness under pressure and the ability to work with the best that the team has to offer. In addition
          to my work as a doula, I co-founded and serve as the treasurer of ZekeFilm, a non-profit seeking to build community through cinema.
           I also currently serve as the treasurer on the board of the Doulas of Greater St Louis, a non-profit focused on educating and supporting
           local doulas. I have recently completed the education track of CoderGirl at LaunchCode in Front End Web Development and am actively
           building my portfolio as I move into the project track. I am currently focusing on building up my JavaScript skills as well as working on
           some projects. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/swtudor">GitHub</a> for the latest.
